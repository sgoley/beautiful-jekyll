## LinkedIn

Last week I was invited to publish a short article about the recent news of Bitcoin gaining a billion USD in market cap over last week. I believed that the best way to contribute my unique view was to create a small application similar to many of the analytics projects and dashboards that I develop and maintain as part of my current position. The resulting article can be viewed here on LinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/interactive-timeline-bitcoin-market-cap-scott-goley>.

The application itself is also viewable directly at:
